## Getting Started

### Basic setup
We recommend you use Node v14.15.1 for this assignment, but we expect that any version beginning with v12.0.0 will work.

 After you clone this repo, you'll need to run `npm install` (once), and then run
`npm start`. 

This repo was generated with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and thus uses [webpack-dev-server](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server).
When you run `npm start`, webpack-dev-server will open a new browser tab or window with the running app.
Changes you make will be compiled automatically, and you should see the page refresh.


### Key tools and concepts

Our app uses [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Thunk](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk). Here's a [good explanation of thunks](https://daveceddia.com/what-is-a-thunk/).

*We recognize that it may take some time to familiarize yourself with these tools*
